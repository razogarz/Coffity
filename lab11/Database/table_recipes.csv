0;18g ground espresso, or 1 espresso pod 100ml milk You will also need the right cup, 150-200ml capacity;STEP 1 Make around 35ml espresso using your coffee machine and pour into the base of your cup. STEP 2 Steam the milk with the steamer attachment so that it has around 1-2cm of foam on top. Hold the jug so that the spout is about 3-4cm above the cup and pour the milk in steadily. As the volume within the cup increases, bring the jug as close to the surface of the drink as possible whilst aiming to pour into the centre. Once the milk jug is almost touching the surface of the coffee, tilt the jug to speed up the rate of pour. As you accelerate, the milk will hit the back of the cup and start naturally folding in on itself to create a pattern on the top.
1;18g ground espresso (or 1 espresso pod) 150ml milk To serve cocoa powder (optional) You will also need the right cup, 200-250ml capacity;STEP 1 Make around 35ml espresso using a coffee machine and pour it into the base of your cup. STEP 2 Steam the milk with the steamer attachment so that it has around 4-6cm of foam on top. Hold the jug so that the spout is about 3-4cm above the cup and pour the milk in steadily. As the volume within the cup increases, bring the jug as close to the surface of the drink as possible whilst aiming to pour into the centre. Once the milk jug is almost touching the surface of the coffee, tilt the jug to speed up the rate of pour. As you accelerate, the milk will hit the back of the cup and start naturally folding in on itself to create a pattern on the top. Dust the surface with a little cocoa powder if you like.

STEP 2 Steam the milk with the steamer attachment so that it has around 2-3cm of foam on top. Hold the jug so that the spout is about 3-4cm above the cup and pour the milk in steadily. As the volume within the cup increases, bring the jug as close to the surface of the drink as possible whilst aiming to pour into the centre. Once the milk jug is almost touching the surface of the coffee, tilt to speed up the rate of pour. As you accelerate, the milk will hit the back of the cup and start naturally folding in on itself to create a pattern on the top.
3;3 tbsp instant coffee 2 tbsp sugar 400-500ml milk (we used whole milk);STEP 1 Whisk the coffee, sugar and 3 tbsp boiling water in a bowl for approximately 5 mins until the mixture is thick and fluffy with stiff peaks. This is easiest done using an electric whisk but can be done by hand. STEP 2 For hot coffee, heat the milk and pour into two heatproof glasses. For cold coffee, pour the cold milk into two glasses. Divide the coffee mixture in half and spoon evenly on top of the glasses. Serve and stir thoroughly before drinking.

7;18g ground espresso, or 1 espresso pod 250ml milk 1 tsp drinking chocolate You will also need large cup, 300-350ml capacity;STEP 1 Make around 35ml espresso using a coffee machine and pour into the base of your cup. Add the drinking chocolate and mix well until smooth. STEP 2 Steam the milk with the steamer attachment so that it has around 4-6cm of foam on top. Hold the jug so that the spout is about 3-4cm above the cup and pour the milk in steadily. As the volume within the cup increases, bring the jug as close to the surface of the drink as possible whilst aiming into the centre. Once the milk jug is almost touching the surface of the coffee, tilt to speed up the rate of pour. As you accelerate, the milk will hit the back of the cup and start naturally folding in on itself to create a pattern on the top.
8;150ml milk 25g milk or dark chocolate buttons ice 35ml freshly made espresso 30ml double cream, whipped (optional) pinch cocoa powder or cinnamon, or both (optional);STEP 1 Pour 50ml of the milk into a small pan and add the chocolate buttons.

9;170g butter or margarine, plus extra for the tins 170g caster sugar 3 large eggs 170g self-raising flour 1 tbsp cooled instant coffee, dissolved in 1 tbsp hot water (add more if you like it stronger) For the icing 225g icing sugar 100g butter or margarine 1½ tbsp instant coffee, dissolved in 1 tbsp hot water strawberry jam (optional) walnuts or cherries, to decorate (optional);STEP 1 Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan. Line and butter two 18cm sandwich tins. Add the sugar and butter to a bowl and whisk until very fluffy and pale. STEP 2 Whisk the eggs in a mug with a fork, then add them gradually to the mixture with 1 tbsp of flour each time. (Make sure you don't use all the flour.) When the eggs have been fully combined into the mix, add the rest of the flour and fold it in gently. STEP 3 Add the dissolved coffee to the mixture, still folding. Divide into the sandwich tins and cook for 25-30 min until risen and firm and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin for 5 mins then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Can be frozen at this stage. STEP 4 Meanwhile, make the icing by beating the icing sugar with the butter until light and fluffy, then add the dissolved coffee. Whisk, then cover and set aside until ready to ice the cake. STEP 5 Spread half the icing on the bottom of one sponge and spread the strawberry jam on the bottom of the other, if using. Sandwich together, then spread the remaining icing on top. Decorate with walnuts or cherries, if you like.
10;115ml strong coffee (such as espresso) 115ml steamed milk;STEP 1 Pour the hot coffee into a large mug (the mug will need to hold 130ml, plus a little foam). Pour over the steamed milk and top with a little of the foam, if you like.

STEP 2 Meanwhile, make the icing. Melt the butter into the coffee, then stir into the icing sugar to make a smooth icing. Once the flapjacks have cooled to room temperature, spread over the icing. Carefully space out your walnut halves, then scatter over the finely chopped walnuts to finish. Leave until the icing is set and firm – you can pop in the fridge to speed up this bit if you like. Will keep in an airtight container for a week.
12;500ml freshly brewed, strong black coffee (we used 30g ground coffee in a cafetière and brewed for 7 mins) 80g golden caster sugar 100ml coffee liqueur (we used Kahlúa) To serve (optional) 1 tub mascarpone 50g dark chocolate, grated;STEP 1 Pour the coffee into a jug and stir in the sugar until it has dissolved. Add the coffee liqueur and leave to cool completely. STEP 2 Once cold, pour the mixture into a freezable container and put in the freezer for 1 hr.

Stir to melt, then set aside to cool. STEP 2 Spoon half the coffee ice cream into the base of the tin and level the surface. Working quickly, spread over a quarter of the chocolate sauce, then half the vanilla ice cream and another quarter of chocolate sauce. Repeat with the remaining chocolate sauce and ice creams, finishing with a layer of chocolate sauce. Cover loosely with cling film and freeze for at least 2 hrs, or ideally overnight. STEP 3 Melt the remaining 50g chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water. Lift the terrine out of the tin and turn out onto a plate.

STEP 3 Beat the egg whites with electric beaters or a balloon whisk until foamy and thickened. Add 1 tbsp sugar and whisk until it forms shiny soft peaks. Take care not to overwhisk – softer is better if you’re not sure. STEP 4 Stir about 1/3 of the egg whites into the chocolate batter to loosen, then carefully fold in the rest of the whites using a large metal spoon or a spatula. STEP 5 Spoon into the prepared tin, then bake for 10-12 mins or until the cakes are just starting to dome in the middle. Cool the cakes in the tin for 15 mins.
